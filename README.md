# OTAEsp
**OTAEsp** is a simple library for the ESP8266 platform that allows you to easily set up an access point (AP) to serve an HTML page, retrieve form data, and connect the device to a Wi-Fi network. It is ideal for implementing Over-the-Air (OTA) updates, web interfaces, or simple device configuration over a network.
